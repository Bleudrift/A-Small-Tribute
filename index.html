      <h2> Why the Tribute?</h2>
      <p id="tribute-info">Learning to code for someone with zero prior experience is not 
        for the faint of heart because initial forays into "coding" can feel 
        like one is diving into the deepest, 
        darkest part of the Mariana Trench &mdash; an inscrutable, alien realm.
        <br>
        <br>
        The learning process itself can be intimidating and overwhelming. The subject matter is a wild, evolving expanse &mdash; 
        so many langages to learn and new ones popping up all the time.  To apprentice to even one language, one needs intestinal fortitude 
        not simply to survive, but to prevail against endless trials, errors, and failures.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fortunately, there is a community that supports, encourages, and celebrates the coding novice 
        &mdash; #100DaysofCode community on Twitter.  Here's why that online group is awesome for anyone (but especially newbies) who are learning to code:
        <ul>
          <li>Warm, welcoming, <span class="highlight">supportive</span> community of like-minded individuals;</li>
          <li>Culture is characterized by <span class="highlight">continuous 
            learning</span>;</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Resources galore</span>;</li>
          <li>Awareness that ALL developers aspire to learn regardless of experience;</li>
          <li>The guiding principle is to <span class="highlight">lift up others</span> in the community;</li> 
          <li><span class="highlight">Safe space</span> to freely share frustrations, victories, and humor; </li>
          <li>Suggestions, insights offered with courteous, unpretentious friendliness;</li>
          <li>Opportunity to <span class="highlight">develop friendships</span> with others on the same coding path</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
